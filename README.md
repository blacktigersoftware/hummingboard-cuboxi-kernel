==========================

Work area for merging SolidRun, BoundaryDevices and Freescale linux kernels.

After being frustrated with the lack of progress from SolidRun's linux kernel
updates and being unable to build supported releases of various Freescale 
patches from Yocto, I decided to attempt to do the merging myself, with a 
little help from my friends.

Freescale is the master upstream, followed by BoundaryDevice's kernel updates
with appropriate hardware level patches from SolidRun.
